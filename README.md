# Arabic Movies App

"**Arabic Movies App**" is a project I am currently working on.
   The main idea behind this project is to provide a fun and exiting way to learn a new language (German or English for native Arabic speakers and Arabic for non-Arabic speakers) and to explore the culture of the Arabic World, which is, I guarantee you, not as the media deceived couch-potatoes with since ages!

> Technologies: React.js, Node.js and PostgresSQL.


   I came up with this idea because of two reasons:

1. I was desperately looking for a platform through which I can watch my favorite Arabic
   movies in German since the first time I arrived
   Germany in 2013. Alas, I could not find any!
2. Couple of my non-Arabic-speakers friends wanted to know more about Syria and the Middle
   East culture. They asked me to recommend some
   Arabic movies. I could roughly find ten movies in which two of them are translated (very bad translation BTW) and the rest are not. Moreover, all of them were very old.

   Since I am a web developer, why don't I go get good movies and build that platform myself?


#Two groups are targeted in this project:
1. **Native speakers of Arabic who are willing to learn German and/or English**.

   There are hundred of thousands of Arabic nationals who either fled their home countries to Europe due to the current crisis or residing since decades in Europe, especially in Germany. This project will facilitate their integration process in a European society. To all who may not know, non-German speaking nationals are required to study the language and achieve a decent level so they can, at least, get the permission to work. Hundred of thousands of them would have to wait until they get there residency (estimated 1-2 year), as of refugees, for example.
2. **Non Arabic speakers who are willing to learn Arabic and explore the Middle East
   cultures**.

   There are tens of means to learn foreign languages. Lots of people like to learn a language through listening to songs, for example
   What about watching foreign-language movies with your favorite language subtitles? Sounds appealing?


# What have been actually developed by now?
I built the basis of the project and included these features:
- [X] User Authentication: Registration/Login.
- [X] Connect to the YouTube API.
- [X] Allow users to edit their info they signed up with.

   I am still developing some features to be suited with the final version. Unfortunately, it will all depend on how far the German bureaucracy would affect its progress.

# What is in mind now?
- [ ] Contacting potential sponsors.
- [ ] Obtaining the copy rights of movies.

   Both are essential for the project to go on.


# What is in mind after that?
- [ ] Get a collection of Arabic Movies.
- [ ] Basic and premium subscription plans.
- [ ] Provide movies subtitles in German, English and (Arabic).
- [ ] Website should be available in 3 languages: German/ English/ Arabic.


   Estimated time to finish this project depends mainly on obtaining the copyrights permissions of the movies.
   I am going to implement any features I think it is going to be necessary for the meantime. If you have any suggestions or advices, I would appreciate contacting me at:  **ashour.m@live.de**
